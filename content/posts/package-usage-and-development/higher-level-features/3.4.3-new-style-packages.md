## New-Style Packages

As of version 10 or so there is a new package format that may be used to more easily handle complicated package setups. It involves a set of static tokens that one uses to tell the system how to distribute definitions and expose contexts and things. These are:

* ```Package```  — must be at the top of a package file, tells the system it's a package and the package name

* ```PackageExport```  — tells the system that a given symbol will be exposed at top level

* ```PackageScope```  — tells the system that a given symbol should be exposed at the package level

* ```PackageImport```  — tells the system to import a given context and expose it within that file

Any symbol not tagged with  ```PackageExport```  or  ```PackageScope```  gets a context that is private to that file. 

A sample paclet structure might look like:

```none
 MyPaclet 
  + PacletInfo.m 
  Kernel 
   + init.m 
  MyPaclet.m 
  Component1.m 
  Component2.m 
  ...
```

Each component would look like:

    Package["MyPaclet`"]
    
    PackageImport["Dependency1`"]
    PackageImport["Dependency2`"]
    ...
    
    PackageExport["Symbol1"]
    PackageExport["Symbol2"]
    ...
    
    PackageScope["PkgSym1"]
    PackageScope["PkgSym2"]
    ...
    
    sym1[]:=...
    Symbol1[]:=... 
    
    ...

Note a few interesting features:

* There is no  ```Begin```  or  ```BeginPackage```  or anything like that

* The tokens must be declared standalone, without even a  ```;```  at the end

* We don't explicitly tell the system to load all the components—it does this automatically

This allows for much simpler package construction and is a good clean strategy for developing packages

### Package` Context

Even better, there are tools at hand for analyzing/working with these packages. These are the functions in the  ```"Package`"```  context. There'll be a little reference guide on them, but for now here's a quick rundown of how they work:

* ```PackageInformation```  — extracts info for new style packages

* ```LoadPackage```  — loads a new style package

* ```DeclareLoad```  — sets up autoloading for a package

* ```ActivateLoad```  — set by  ```DeclareLoad```  to delegate to  ```LoadPackage```

* ```CreatePackageCache```  — generates a .mx redux of a package for optimized loading
