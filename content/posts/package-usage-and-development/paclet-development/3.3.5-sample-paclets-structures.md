## Sample Paclets

It can be unclear what type of directory/paclet info structure we want, so we'll go over a number of the different common types.

Keep in mind that you can always mix-and-match with these template structures. I'm just showing how a pure, modularized paclet of each type can be constructed.

### Code Paclet

The most common type of paclet is one that just serves code and maybe some front-end/system resources. To get this type of paclet up-and-running we'll take our directory structure to look something like:

```none
 MyPaclet 
  + PacletInfo.m 
  Kernel 
   + init.m 
   + Component1.m 
   + Component2.m 
   ...
 + MyPaclet.m
```

And the  ```PacletInfo.m```  will be 

    Paclet[
      Name        -> "MyPaclet",
      Version     -> "1.0.0",
      Creator     -> "me <me@me.me>",
      Description -> "A world-changing application",
      Extensions  ->{
        {"Kernel", "Root"->".", "Context"->{"MyPaclet`"}}
        }
      ]

### Documentation Paclet

Sometimes we  *just*  want to distribute documentation, as it can be bulky and unwieldy. If this is the case, we'll want to use a directory structure that looks like:

The most common type of paclet is one that just serves code and maybe some front-end/system resources. To get this type of paclet up-and-running we'll take our directory structure to look something like:

```none
 Documentation_MyPaclet 
  + PacletInfo.m 
  Documentation 
   English 
    ReferencePages 
     Symbols 
      + SymbolPage1.nb 
      + SymbolPage2.nb 
      ... 
     Guides 
      + MyPaclet.nb 
      + Guide1.nb 
      ... 
     Tutorials 
      + Tutorial1.nb 
      + Tutorial2.nb 
      ...
```

And the  ```PacletInfo.m```  will be 

    Paclet[
      Name        -> "Documentation_MyPaclet",
      Version     -> "0.0.1",
      Creator     -> "me <me@me.me>",
      Description -> "Documentation for MyPaclet",
      Extensions  ->{
        {
          "Documentation",
        "Root"->".", 
        "LinkBase"->"MyPaclet",
          "MainPage"->"Guides/MyPaclet"
          }
        }
      ]

We use a small version number that won't conflict with the main MyPaclet ever

### FrontEnd Paclet

Sometimes we want to package versioned FE resources separately from a package, or simply pass around standalone palettes and stylesheets. If this is the case we want a front-end paclet, which has a directory structure like:

```none
 FrontEnd_MyPaclet 
  + PacletInfo.m 
  FrontEnd 
   StyleSheets 
    MyPaclet 
     + StyleSheet1.nb 
     ... 
   Palettes 
    MyPaclet 
     + Palettes.nb 
     ... 
   SystemResources 
    MyPaclet 
     + SystemResource1.nb 
     + SystemResource2.txt 
     + SystemResource3.png 
     ... 
    Bitmaps 
     MyPaclet 
      + Bitmap1.png 
      + Bitmap2.png 
      ... 
  TextResources 
   MyPaclet 
    + TextResource1.tr 
    + TextResource2.tr 
    ...
```

And we'd have a pretty simple   ```PacletInfo.m```  

    Paclet[
      Name        -> "FrontEnd_MyPaclet",
      Version     -> "0.0.1",
      Creator     -> "me <me@me.me>",
      Description -> "FrontEnd resources for MyPaclet",
      Extensions  ->{ {"FrontEnd"} }
      ]

### Resource Paclet

Sometimes we want to package versioned FE resources separately from a package, or simply pass around standalone palettes and stylesheets. If this is the case we want a front-end paclet, which has a directory structure like:

```none
 Resources_MyPaclet 
  + PacletInfo.m 
  Resources 
   + Resource1.mx 
   Templates 
    + Template1.nb 
    + Template2.nb 
    ...
  ... 
```

And we'll have a   ```PacletInfo.m```  that looks like:

    Paclet[
      Name        -> "Resources_MyPaclet",
      Version     -> "0.0.1",
      Creator     -> "me <me@me.me>",
      Description -> "Basic resources for MyPaclet",
      Extensions  ->{ 
        {
          "Resource",
          "Root"->"Resources",
          "Resources"->
            {
              {"Resource1", "Resource1.mx"},
              {"Template1", "Templates/Template1.mx"},
              {"Template2", "Templates/Template2.mx"}
              }
          }
        }
      ]

### Data Paclet

Before its curated data system got wrapped into the  [```Entity Framework```](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/KnowledgeRepresentationAndAccess.html) ,  Mathematica distributed its curated data via the  ```DataPaclets```  system. These are resource paclets that simply distribute version controlled data.

We can still make use of this system ourselves, though, as done  [here](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/q/146220/38205) . Even if we don't want to hook into that system directly, we can make use of this kind of setup by setting up a directory like:

```none
 Data_MyPaclet 
  + PacletInfo.m 
  Data 
   + MyPacletData.wdx 
   + MyPacletHDF5Data.h5 
   ...
```

Then the   ```PacletInfo.m```  looks almost exactly like a resource paclet

    Paclet[
      Name        -> "Data_MyPaclet",
      Version     -> "0.0.1",
      Creator     -> "me <me@me.me>",
      Description -> "Data for MyPaclet",
      Extensions  ->{
        {
          "Resource",
        "Root"->"Data", 
        "Resources"->
         {
          {"Data", "MyPacletData.wdx"},
          {"HDF5Data", "MyPacletHDF5Data.h5"},
          ...
              }
          }
        }
      ]
