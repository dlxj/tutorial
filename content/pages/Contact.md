## Contact

If  you need to contact me, there are a few ways to do it. For many inquiries, email will work. My email is  [b3m2a1@gmail.com](mailto:b3m2a1%40gmail.com) .

If you want help from a more public form (recommended) you can ping me on the  [Mathematica StackExchange chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2234/wolfram-mathematica) .

Finally, I'm trying out including comments on pages, so there is a comment area at the bottom of this page. I'll see all the posted comments (and helpfully so will everyone else). If this works well I might expand this to some other pages and posts.
