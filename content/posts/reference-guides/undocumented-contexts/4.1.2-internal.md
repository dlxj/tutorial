## Internal

The  ```"Internal`"```  context is one of the core contexts that Mathematica uses. It's got no targeted focus, but rather appears to be a place where developers dump the cruft they don't know what to do with.

### Bag

Provides a general purpose container that has efficient push and pop behavior. Especially useful in  ```Compile``` .

See  [here](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/q/845/38205)

### StuffBag

Used with  ```Internal`Bag```

See  [here](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/q/845/38205)

### BagPart

Used with  ```Internal`Bag```

See  [here](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/q/845/38205)

### WithLocalSettings

Allows for a setup block that will be evaluated before a code block and a tear-down block that will evaluate  *no matter what errors are raised in the code block* . This is highly-useful for error handling.

The function  ```GeneralUtilities`SetupTeardown```  provides a mild generalization on this.

See  [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7586910/5720002)  or  [here](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/1603/38205)

### InheritedBlock

Allows for definitions to be preserved, but otherwise uses  ```Block```  semantics. Very useful for metaprogramming and overloading.

See  [here](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/25771/38205)

### WithTimestampsPreserved

This is a tricky function that tells the kernel to preserve some amount of old-state for efficiency/control reasons.

See  [here](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/168166/38205)

### LoadingPanel

This just makes a nicely formatted panel with a 9-patch  ```Appearance```  argument:

    Internal`LoadingPanel@"Hello World"

    (*Out:*)

### Handlers

A system of internal handlers for various events that occur. Generally best used with  ```Internal`HandlerBlock``` .

See  [here](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/139718/38205)

### HandlerBlock

This acts in much the same way to the handlers, but can treat them in a  ```Block``` -like fashion.

### LocalizedBlock

Like  ```Block```  but can localize some non- ```Symbol```  arguments.
