## Calculus

Mathematica is useful for many types of mathematical operations, but of particular use are derivatives and integrals.

### Derivatives

Derivatives can be taken using either the function  ```D``` or the alias pd.

For example, to take the first derivative of  ```x^2``` one can use either of the following:

    D[x^2,x]

    (*Out:*)
    
    2 x

or

    Subscript[∂, x]x^2

    (*Out:*)
    
    2 x

A derivative can be taken of a derivative:

    Subscript[∂, x]Subscript[∂, x]x^2

    (*Out:*)
    
    2

But this is equivalent to a simple second derivative which Mathematica can also do:

    D[x^2,{x,2}]

    (*Out:*)
    
    2

or

    Subscript[∂, x, x]x^2

    (*Out:*)
    
    2

We can also take derivatives in multiple variables:

    Subscript[∂, x, y]1/Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]

    (*Out:*)
    
    (3 x y)/(x^2 + y^2)^(5/2)

Here's that but formatted better:

$$\frac{3 x y}{\left(x^2+y^2\right)^{5/2}}$$

And then for fun let's plot this:

    dxy=Subscript[∂, x, y]1/Sqrt[x^2 + y^2];
    Plot3D[dxy,{x,-5,5},{y,-5,5}]

    (*Out:*)

### Integration

Mathematica also knows how to do more integrals than any chemist is likely to need. The function for integration is  ```Integrate``` although like with derivatives there is an alias via intt for indefinite integrals and dintt for definite integrals

Here's the standard form for  ```Integrate``` :

    Integrate[2,x]

    (*Out:*)
    
    2 x

And here's the alias form:

    ∫2x

    (*Out:*)
    
    2 x

And just to show that Mathematica observes the fundamental theorem of calculus like the rest of us:

    ∫∫dxyxy

    (*Out:*)
    
    1/Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]

Again, here's the same but formatted better:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$$

And we'll plot this too:

    reversedxy=∫∫dxy xy;
    Plot3D[reversedxy,{x,-5,5},{y,-5,5}]

    (*Out:*)

### Fun examples:

Mathematica is a great calculus tool and it knows many types of interesting functions so we'll have it integrate the following nasty function for us:

$$P_3(\cos (\theta )) \cot (\theta ) \frac{\partial P_4(\cos (\theta ))}{\partial \theta }$$

where  $P_i(\cos (\theta ))$ is the  $i^{\text{th}}$ Legendre polynomial in  $\cos (\theta )$

    Integrate[LegendreP[3,Cos[θ]]Cot[θ]D[LegendreP[4,Cos[θ]],θ],{θ,0,π}]

    (*Out:*)
    
    0

but Mathematica has absolutely no problem evaluating this integral. It can even tell you that switching the derivative and cot terms makes the integral impossible to evaluate.

    Integrate[LegendreP[3,Cos[θ]]D[Cot[θ]LegendreP[4, Cos[θ]],θ], {θ,0,π}]

$$\int_0^{\pi } \frac{1}{2} \left(-3 \cos (\theta )+5 \cos ^3(\theta )\right) \left(-\frac{1}{8} \left(3-30 \cos ^2(\theta )+35 \cos ^4(\theta )\right) \csc ^2(\theta )+\frac{1}{8} \cot (\theta ) \left(60 \cos (\theta ) \sin (\theta )-140 \cos ^3(\theta ) \sin (\theta )\right)\right) \, d\theta$$

And when it sees that it simply returns the integral unevaluated
