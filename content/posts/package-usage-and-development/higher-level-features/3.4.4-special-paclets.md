## Special Paclet Formats

Mathematica uses a number of specially constructed paclets to drive some of its frameworks. We'll briefly talk about these frameworks and how they showcase what paclets can do.

## Curated Data

The curated data framework has been in Mathematica since version 6. As I understand it, it is the Ur-usage for paclets. These paclets drive almost all the functions ending in  ```Data``` , like  ```ChemicalData``` ,  ```ElementData``` , and  ```ExampleData``` .

A curated data function is in some sense a paclet is a divided into 3 chunks. 

There is a code paclet that looks like:

```none
 <DataType>Data 
  + PacletInfo.m 
  Kernel 
   + init.m 
  <DataType>Data.m
```

which configures a function  ```<DataType>Data```  that acts as a router to two resource paclets. 

The first resource paclet is looks like

```none
 <DataType>Data_Index 
  + PacletInfo.m 
  Data 
   + Index.wdx 
   + Functions.wdx 
   + Names.wdx 
   + Groups.wdx 
   + Properties.wdx 
   + PrivateGroups.wdx
```

And the raw data distributes over a number of paclets that look like

```none
 <DataType>Data_Part01 
  + PacletInfo.m 
  Data 
   + Part01.wdx
```

### ExampleData

The  [```ExampleData```](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ExampleData.html)  system works in a similar way to the bulk curated data, but since it provides more specialized resources it serves them in a slightly different way. Each of its resources looks like:

```none
 ExampleData_<DataName>
 + PacletInfo.m 
  Data 
   + <DataName>.wdx
```

You can leverage this to make it serve your own resources with a bit of work.

## Service Connections

The  [```Service Connections Framework```](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/AccessingExternalServicesAndAPIs.html)  is a good example of the flexibility of the paclet system. It provides a general set of high-level functions  ```ServiceConnect``` ,  ```ServiceExecute``` ,  ```ServiceDisconnect``` , and low-level infrastructure that allow paclets to provide flexible connections to APIs with little effort.

Every service in the  [```$Services```](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/%24Services.html)  list provides a paclet which looks like:

```none
 ServiceConnection_<ServiceName>
 + PacletInfo.m 
  Kernel 
   + load.m 
   + <ServiceName>.m 
   + <ServiceName>Load.m 
   + <ServiceName>Functions.m
```

The framework first calls  ```load.m```  which then loads the other packages. In the end a single set of functions is returned that encapsulates all the API parameters that the service provides.
