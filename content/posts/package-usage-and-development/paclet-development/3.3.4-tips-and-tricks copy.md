## Paclet Directories

When developing a paclet it can be useful to be able to test code without having to uninstall and reinstall the paclet. That's why there's a  ```PacletDirectory*```   mechanism that makes this easier. We can use the function  ```PacletDirectoryAdd```  to add another directory in which paclets will be looked for. When we're done with this we can use  ```PacletDirectoryRemove```  to clear the directory and test what development looks like without the code being directly accessible.
